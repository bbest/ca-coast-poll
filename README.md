## Old Resources

These resources were created when previously looking at this opinion poll 2019-02:

- [calcoastpoll](http://benbestphd.com/calcoastpoll/index.html): R package
  - [Analyze Poll Data](http://benbestphd.com/calcoastpoll/articles/analyze.html): vignette
- [calcoastpoll-tutorial](http://benbestphd.com/calcoastpoll-tutorial/index.html): bookdown


### Binder Setup

Here's how the necessary files were created in this repository for the "Launch Rstudio Binder" link to work:

```r
library(holepunch)
write_compendium_description(
  package     = "ca-coast-poll", 
  description = "California coastal poll analysis and introduction to R")
# to write a description, with dependencies. Be sure to fill in placeholder text

write_dockerfile(maintainer = "Ben Best") 
# To write a Dockerfile. It will automatically pick the date of the last 
# modified file, match it to that version of R and add it here. You can 
# override this by passing r_date to some arbitrary date
# (but one for which a R version exists).

generate_badge() # This generates a badge for your readme.

# ----------------------------------------------
# At this time ðŸ™Œ push the code to GitHub ðŸ™Œ
# ----------------------------------------------

# And click on the badge or use the function below to get the build 
# ready ahead of time.
build_binder()
